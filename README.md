# Web Scraping Project

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is designed to extract data from a target website and process it for analysis. The scraping task leverages Python's `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, and optionally `Selenium` for dynamic content. The data is stored in CSV format and can be automated for regular updates.

### Key Features:
- Extract specific data from static and dynamic websites.
- Clean and process data into structured formats (CSV, JSON).
- Use Selenium to interact with JavaScript-heavy sites.
- Automate data scraping with scheduling.
